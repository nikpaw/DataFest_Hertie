# DataFest Hackathon Project 2023

This project was developed by a team of five Hertie School students over one weekend for the DataFest Hackathon in Munich. Our goal was to use the data provided to us to develop insights about companies in the regions of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Bayern over the years 2007 to 2023. Our preliminary project proposal aimed to construct better economic policies and create more jobs in a more accurate and effective way by providing insight on the link between newly founded companies and increased local employment.

Our project provides insights about how different companies have been created in the municipalities in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg over time. We were able to locally map the distribution of companies founded in these states and created a starting point to build a predictor model on this data. We generated a dataset with close to 29.000.000 observations that allows to assess the impact of company foundings on employment levels. 

Using this dataset, subsequent prediction model could determine the effect on the job market in the different municipalities when company creations are encouraged and incentivized. The idea is that this tool could serve as a guide for (local) economic policies, as a predictor for economic developments, or indicate increasing future demand for workforce by municipality and industry.
